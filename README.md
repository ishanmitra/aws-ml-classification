## Overview<a name="overview"></a> ##
This is a project in Udacityâ€™s AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree geared towards building an ML workflow.

The project uses a sample dataset called CIFAR to simulate an image classification model. The machine learning workflow for Image Classification is deployed using AWS resources such as, `sagemaker` and `boto3` SDKs, image-classification built-in algorithm, Lambda functions and Step Function Workflow, and SageMaker model monitor and endpoint.  

The CIFAR dataset is open source and can be downloaded at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-100-python.tar.gz  

The goal of this project is to:  
1. Build an image classification model that differentiates between bicycles and motorcycles.
2. Deploy the model for inference using AWS Lambda functions and AWS Step functions.

The best image classification model has a test accuracy of 0.848958.  

The visual below shows whether the images are inferred as a motorbike or a bicycle with their probability scores. Text is red if it is below the confidence threshold of 0.93.
